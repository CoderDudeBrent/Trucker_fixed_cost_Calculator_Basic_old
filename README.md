# Trucker_fixed_cost_Calculator_Basic
I've been coding a week and 3 days as of completing this, I drive 18 wheelers for a living so I don't get much time to write code. I want to be a full time dev. This is my first contribution.
its a simple fixed cost calculator placed on a very basic web page. I'm just testing the waters and I want to get some projects out. Proud of this first one. 

Completely open to critique, if you stumble accross this, let me know if there are other methods and possibly share with what I may try better.

Thanks!
